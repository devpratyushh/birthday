Hailoo to my cutieee pookieee kuchupuchuuuu, Hiii Anandita, kaisi hai meri jaaan!
Dur dur se udte udte khabar aai hai ki aaj kisi ka bday and to humne v socha ki thoda Happie
Happie Birthdayyy hum v bol dee anddd yoo welcome to adulting, life’s gonna change a lot for
both of us in the next couple of years, so brace yourself for all the fun things life has to offer –
Oh shitt I sound like sandeep maheshwari but from chor bazaar lol (tried to be funny part 1 😂)
Life has never been same since I unexpectedly met someone (very gora) in my sarkari school
and things aren’t the same since the first “ye aage kyu hai” to you yelling “pandittt”, My love, this
pandit has been touched by your embrace and couldn’t thank god enough for this cozzz – “Rab
ne bana di jodi”.
From the very first time I saw you to that confession in just two days, there was something
magical about you which drew me more and more towards you, talking an entire night even
though my “proposal” didn’t work out as I expected. Wait.. I know my expectations were crazy to
go and ask out someone who I have just met but you know Anandita there was something about
you which made me believe that if i did the right efforts and right things i would have you, i
would call you “mine” and look here we are – from you and me to us, It has been a long journey
but nothing in front of the journey we have ahead of us and I wish to hold your hand, to hold
your hand “once and for all”.
It’s just the beginning of the many more birthdays we would celebrate together, with the little
nok-jhok with the little kalesh and aaa lot of funnn which we have together in this journey called
life or better “our life”.
The high school romance which I always used to talk about has just began there’s a lot to come
my love and yrr when I look back at the time we had together I am sure nothing can ever top
that, from being in despression ki kal ke exam ke lie kch to padhe hi nahi hai to the fact that i
would be able to see you, it truly was an experience love, from whispering “Btw Hi” to the “cafe
hai kya” to the cute little pouch exchange we had it all holdssss a very very deep place in my
heard and how could i forget the chocolates we shared during the exams, I had the best 1
month of my life with you and not to mention me trying to talk to you chche wo ITF padhane ke
bahane ya english literature ki random baate and guess what we talked like 4 hours loll sooo yk
it ki hm kitna bolte hai and agar hm avi nahi ruke to pages badh jayengi and yk me gareeb
blinkit wale paishe le lenge extra lol.
Ik Anandita this is not the prettiest letter one could give neither this is the best but love this is
filled with emotions and my love for you, I don’t know when I will get to see you next but until
then its your 2010 was Situaa saying “I love youu babe I lovee you aaa lott 💗” , I have said this
quite a lot and I am saying this again If you would have no one by your side you will find me, I
don’t want to be very dramatic coz ik actions greater than wordsss and amidst all the daily
chaos I promise to be always yours babe!
